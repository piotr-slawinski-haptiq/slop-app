# SLOP Scope

From [slop-app-plan.md](slop-app-plan.md) §6 Scope. Do not add MVP scope that contradicts this.

## In scope (MVP)

- **Catalog**: Items with name, category, **is_evergreen**. CRUD by orderer.
- **Requests**: item, requester, status; linked to fulfillment when list is fulfilled. No quantity or notes.
- **Fulfillment**: trigger (immediate | threshold), status, **fulfilled_at** (auto); orderer marks as fulfilled; list clears.
- **Fulfillment threshold**: Configurable (min items only—min_pending_items); orderer can change.
- **Single shared list**: One instance per product; everyone sees the same items. No batching window.
- **Auth and roles**: orderer vs colleague; @haptiq.com only.
- **Notifications**: Notify orderer when immediate (evergreen added) or threshold reached. In-app first; no Slack for MVP.

## Out of scope (MVP)

- **Inventory tracking** – No stock levels, shelves, or “inventory” subdomain.
- **Manual order cycles** – No “open/close week” or week-based cycles.
- **Approvals, budgets, cost tracking** – Not in MVP.
- **Multi-office** – Single office/tenant only.
- **Slack** – No Slack integration in MVP.

## Later (V2+)

- Recurring evergreen suggestions (e.g. “milk every Monday”).
- Export list (CSV/PDF).
- Slack: add request, notify on fulfillment, “What’s on the list?”.

When proposing features or API changes, check they fit “In scope” and do not reintroduce “Out of scope” concepts (e.g. inventory or multi-office) without an explicit plan change.
