# SLOP Stack and Plan

**SLOP** = Shopping List Ordering Platform. Product and technical spec: [slop-app-plan.md](slop-app-plan.md).

## Stack (non-negotiable)

| Layer      | Choice             | Notes                                                                           |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Full-stack | TanStack Start     | File-based routing, loaders, actions; Vinxi/Bun. Use Context7 for current docs. |
| Styling    | CSS Modules        | `*.module.css` colocated with components. See `slop-styling.mdc`.               |
| Runtime    | Bun                | `bun run`, `bun test`, `bunx` in scripts.                                       |
| Data       | PostgreSQL         | No SQLite.                                                                      |
| Auth       | @haptiq.com only   | Magic link; session cookies for persistence. See `slop-auth.mdc`.               |
| Slack      | Out of scope (MVP) | V2+.                                                                            |

## Other project rules

- **slop-domain-and-data.mdc** – Entities, fields, invariants (one list, one instance per product, no quantity/notes, fulfilled_at auto).
- **slop-auth.mdc** – Who can sign in, roles (orderer vs colleague), where to enforce.
- **slop-ux-and-ui.mdc** – Design and UX from the plan (central list, cards, omnisearch, scatter-on-fulfill).
- **slop-design-system.mdc** – Visual style and design system inspired by Blinkit (Lambda): palette, typography, tokens, Atomic Design.
- **slop-styling.mdc** – CSS Modules conventions.
- **slop-scope.mdc** – In/out of scope for MVP; avoid inventory, multi-office, etc.

When adding features or API surface, match the plan’s domain model and flows; re-read the relevant plan section if unsure.
